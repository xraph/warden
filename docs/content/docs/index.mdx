Warden is a composable permissions and authorization engine for Go. It answers the fundamental question: **"Is this subject allowed to perform this action on this resource?"**

Warden combines three authorization models into a unified engine:

- **RBAC** — Role-Based Access Control with hierarchical roles, permissions, and assignments
- **ABAC** — Attribute-Based Access Control with policy conditions (IP ranges, time windows, custom attributes)
- **ReBAC** — Relationship-Based Access Control (Zanzibar-style) with relation tuples and graph traversal

## Key Features

- **Unified Check API** — A single `Check()` call evaluates RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC together
- **Decision Priority** — Explicit deny always wins over allow, which wins over default deny
- **Type-Safe IDs** — TypeID-based identifiers for all entities (`wrol_`, `wprm_`, `wasn_`, `wpol_`, `wrel_`)
- **Multi-Tenant** — Every operation is scoped to a tenant via context
- **Pluggable Stores** — Memory, PostgreSQL, and SQLite backends
- **Plugin System** — Lifecycle hooks for audit logging, metrics, and custom integrations
- **Forge Integration** — First-class Forge extension with DI, middleware, and OpenAPI routes
- **Standalone Mode** — Use without Forge as a plain Go library

## Quick Example

```go
eng, _ := warden.NewEngine(
    warden.WithStore(memoryStore),
)

result, _ := eng.Check(ctx, &warden.CheckRequest{
    Subject:      warden.Subject{Kind: "user", ID: "user-42"},
    Action:       "read",
    ResourceType: "document",
    ResourceID:   "doc-123",
})

if result.Allowed {
    // Access granted
}
```
